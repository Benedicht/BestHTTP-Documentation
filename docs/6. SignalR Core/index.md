# SignalR Core

The new [SignalR Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-3.0) protocol is a new iteration for the SignalR family. It tries to keep and improve what worked and remove the bad, but this also means that it's not backward compatible.

To continue with SignalR Core read about the [HubConnection](1 The HubConnection Class.md) class.
