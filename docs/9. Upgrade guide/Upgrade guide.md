#Upgrade guide
Upgrading to v1.9.x: In v1.9.0 all DLL dependencies are removed, and some of the files from the source too.

So a clean install is advised:

Before you install v1.9.x you have to remove the /Assets/Best HTTP (Pro)/ folder and the BestHTTP.dll (it's in the Basic version only) and TcpClientImplementation.dll from the /Assets/Plugins/, /Assets/Plugins/Metro and /Assets/Plugins/WP8 folders.
