# Introduction
[BestHTTP/2](http://u3d.as/1E3h "BestHTTP/2") is a HTTP/1.1 and [HTTP/2](7. Global Topics/HTTP2.md) implementation that supports almost all Unity mobile and standalone platforms (see [supported platforms](platforms.md)).
My goal was to create an easy to use, but still powerful plugin to Unity to take advantage of the potential in HTTP/1.1 and later in HTTP/2.

For HTTP requests, the [Getting Started Quickly](1. HTTP Request/Getting Started.md) topic is the next recommended reading.

## Online resources

1. A [WebGL demo page](https://besthttpdemo.azureedge.net/) is available to demonstrate a few capabilities of the plugin. Both the samples and server has its own git repo:
	2. [Samples repository](https://github.com/Benedicht/BestHTTP_Examples). All samples are in the plugin's package too.
	3. [Server repository](https://github.com/Benedicht/BestHTTP_DemoSite)
2. This document is a quick guide, not all functions and properties can be found here, but suggestions, bugreports and pull-requests are always welcome on the documentation's own [github repo](https://github.com/Benedicht/BestHTTP-Documentation).

## Contact

For support, feature request or general questions you can email me at <besthttp@gmail.com>, or create a new issue at the plugin's public [Issues repository](https://github.com/Benedicht/BestHTTP-Issues).
