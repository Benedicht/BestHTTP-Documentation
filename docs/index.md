## Introduction
[BestHTTP/2](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10872 "BestHTTP/2") is a HTTP/1.1 and [HTTP/2](7. Global Topics/HTTP2.md) implementation that supports almost all Unity mobile and standalone platforms (see [supported platforms](platforms.md)).
My goal was to create an easy to use, but still powerful plugin to Unity to take advantage of the potential in HTTP/1.1 and later in HTTP/2.

This document is a quick guide, not all functions and properties can be found here, but suggestions, bugreports and pull-requests are always welcome on the documentation's own [github repo](https://github.com/Benedicht/BestHTTP-Documentation).

For support, feature request or general questions you can email me at <besthttp@gmail.com>.

For HTTP requests, the [Getting Started Quickly](1. HTTP Request/Getting Started.md) topic is the next recommended reading.
