# Introduction
[BestHTTP/2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/best-http-2-155981?aid=1101lfX8E "BestHTTP/2") is a HTTP/1.1 and [HTTP/2](7.GlobalTopics/HTTP2.md) implementation that supports almost all Unity mobile and standalone platforms (see [supported platforms](platforms.md)).
My goal was to create an easy to use, but still powerful plugin to Unity to take advantage of the potential in HTTP/1.1 and later in HTTP/2.

For HTTP requests, the [Getting Started Quickly](1.HTTP/GettingStarted.md) topic is the next recommended reading.

## Available Addons:

1. [TLS Security Addon](8.Addons/TLSSecurity)
2. [cURL Parser Addon](8.Addons/cURLParser)

## Online resources

1. A [WebGL demo page](https://besthttpdemo.azureedge.net/) is available to demonstrate a few capabilities of the plugin. Both the samples and server has its own git repo:
	2. [Samples repository](https://github.com/Benedicht/BestHTTP_Examples). All samples are in the plugin's package too.
	3. [Server repository](https://github.com/Benedicht/BestHTTP_DemoSite)
2. This document is a quick guide, not all functions and properties can be found here, but suggestions, bugreports and pull-requests are always welcome on the documentation's own [github repo](https://github.com/Benedicht/BestHTTP-Documentation).

!!! Notice
	All supported protocols are client implementations only, but all server side solutions (server, framework, cloud hosting, etc.) are supported!
