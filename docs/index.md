# Documentation For BestHTTP
## Introduction
[BestHTTP](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10872 "BestHTTP") is a HTTP/1.1 implementation based on the [RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html "RFC 2616"), that supports almost all Unity mobile and standalone platforms (see [Supported platforms](7. Supported Platforms/Supported Platforms).
My goal was to create an easy to use, but still powerful plugin to Unity to take advantage of the potential in HTTP/1.1.
This document is a quick guide, not all function and property can be found here.

For support, feature request or general questions you can email me at <besthttp@gmail.com>.
