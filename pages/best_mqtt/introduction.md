## Introduction

MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. MQTT today is used in a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and gas, etc.

[Best MQTT](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/209238?aid=1101lfX8E) built on top of [Best HTTP/2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/best-http-2-155981?aid=1101lfX8E) to use the best available solution under Unity3D. By using Best HTTP/2 it can target the same platforms, including WebGL and use it for TCP and WebSocket transports, reduce memory usage with BufferPools, secure connecctions with TLS and use its logging infrastructure.

## Supported Platforms

Same platforms are supported as [Best HTTP/2](../best_http2/platforms.html). Under WebGL only the WebSocket transport can be used and certificate based authentication doesn't work.
